# NewsScraper

## Overview
Use the Hive's Buzz to scrape the latest stories from BuzzFeed! With materialize connected, this page is kept clean and simple to highlight the articles. A friendly bee mascot sticks to the side of the page and completes a new scrape when clicked so that users have all the latest "buzz". Users can save interesting articles by clicking the save button. Saved Articles appear in the "My Articles" tab where users can write their thoughts about the article in a note, or delete the article when they no longer want to save it. Previous notes pop up at the bottom of the "Notes" model to see previous thoughts.
